Instructor Insights
-------------------

{{< quote "Almost all MIT students want to make a difference in the world, but many are not quite sure how to go about it. They´re overwhelmed by the task and they´re not sure how to start. We designed the course to help students identify small changes they can make in their everyday lives that will help them actualize the difference they hope to see." "—Patricia-Maria Weinmann" >}}

Assessment
----------

Grading is pass/fail. The following components are considered when assessing students´ learning:

_Class Participation_

Each seminar meeting includes interactive teaching on a particular topic, designed to equip students for reflection and action. Students are expected to attend every seminar.

_Events_

During the semester, students are expected to attend three [Radius](https://radius.mit.edu) events, public forums, or other pertinent lectures, films, plays, or panel discussions offered at MIT and beyond. Those who are unable to attend an event recommended by an instructor may substitute an alternative event approved by one of the instructors.

_Outside of Class_

Students are expected to be in dialogue with one another online between meetings through the class website. This is an excellent way to continue and deepen discussion begun during class.

_Reading and Writing_

There is very little required reading, but links to recommended readings and other resources can be found in the [Readings]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings) section. Students are encouraged to read the suggested material and explore additional resources for information.

Students are required to submit three short (roughly 250–300 word) reflection papers over the course of the term in response to the outside events they attend. The reflections are due at intervals during the semester.

_Presentations_

During the last class of the term, each student gives a 5–7 minute presentation on their own ethical perspective, as developed over the course of the term.

There is no final exam.
